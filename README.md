## 301 Group Project
## Members: David Cole, Austin Rogers, Luiz Manzo, Steven Johnson

### APIs used: Google Civic Information API

### MONDAY:

Austin and David pair programmed on the branch html-work
- In this branch we created a base html skeleton for the project. We also implemented our dependencies and checked that they actually work.

Steven and Luis pair programmed on steven-monday
- In this branch we did our preliminary coding for our database structure and API implementation.

### TUESDAY

Austin and David pair programmed on html-tues and html-tues-routes. In these branches we got the data from the API call to print to the actual index page as well as being able to be filtered depending on wether or not the user wants to see just federal, state, or city/county officials

Steven and Luis pair programmed on the routing for the API calls to make sure that we were actually getting the data we wanted from the API as well as making sure the data persists throughout the user interaction with the website.
